## Branch Management
1. Branches:
	* remote branch: `origin/master` and `origin/Dev` (origin is the name of github server).  
		> *master branch for release version*  
		> *branch for develop version*
	* local branch: `master`, `Dev`, `YourNameDev`.  
		> *`master` - `origin/master`*  
		> *`Dev` - `origin/Dev`*  
		> *`YourNameDev` for your own develop*

2. Management:
	* When you finish your work, your can merge `YourNameDev` to `Dev` on local repo, and then push local `Dev` branch to remote `origin/Dev` branch.
	* When our develop finish, we will merge `origin/Dev` branch to `origin/master` on remote repo.
